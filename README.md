# Hi! I am Kaiyan (Nathan) Zhang 👋

I do **Economics + Statistics** at **UBC**, and I spend an unreasonable amount of time turning messy data into models that ***mostly*** behave. 
- **Interests**: econometrics, causal inference, time series, statistical learning, NLP, macroeconomics theory, game theory
- **What I do when I'm not studying**: 🏃 Running, 🎮 video games, 🤓 manga & anime (yes, I have opinions)
- **Where you most likely see me?**: UBC Vancouver Campus (almost 365 days)

My goal now is to **gain more industry experience** so that I can understand real-world problems better and learn how to solve them using the methods I personally enjoy (e.g. panel FE models for inference and ensemble methods for prediction).

## What I'm up to right now?

- **Job & Research Searching**: Available full time for up to 16 months
- **Taking courses**:

  - [Computational Optimization](https://friedlander.io/ubc-cpsc-406/)
  - Introduction to Statistical Inference
  - Time Series and Forecasting
- **Projects**
  - Some works for the **[Praxis UBC](https://ubcecon.github.io/praxis-ubc/)**
  - Some NTL $\times$ Crime econometrics project **["Illumi-naughty"](https://github.com/NathanPalaiologos/NTL-Crime-FE)**
  - STAT 443 Group Project: **Forecasting Net Savings of Households and Firms in Canada Using Structural Models**
  - **FX-monitor**
  - **Econometrics Game 2026**: TBD
- **Rewatching [The Fifth Republic](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt25052092/)**
- **Running**: DM me on **[Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/125966060)** if you want to run 10k in the morning together
